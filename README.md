# Object Detection:
	- It is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.
	- Well-researched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection.
	- Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.
